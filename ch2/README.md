# The Observer Pattern

### The weather monitoring application overview
There are three players in the system:
- Weather Station(physical device that acquires the actual weather data)
- WeatherData object(tracks the data coming from the weather station and updates the display)
- The display device which shows users the current weather conditions

### Objective of Weather-O-Rama
Weather-O-Rama has a Weather Station which contains
- Humidity Sensor Device
- Temperature Sensor Device
- Pressure Sensor Device

### What we implement
WeatherData object which pulls data from Weather Station and shows the data in any display device.

WeatherData object updates its displayes for the three different display elements:
- Current Conditions
    - Temperature
    - Humidity
    - Pressure
- Weather Statistics
- Forecast

### Unpacking the WeatherData
WeatherData
- getTemparature()
- getHumidity()
- getPressure()
- measurementsChanged() [gets called whenever the weather measurements have been updated]

Job is to implement the measurementsChanged() so that it updates the three displays for current conditions, weather stats and forecast

### Things to keep in mind
- These displays must be updated each time WeatherData has new measurements.
- The system must be expandable â€” other developers can create new custom display elements and users can add or remove as many display elements as they want to the application. 

### The observer Pattern
Publishers + Subscribers = Observer Pattern

- we call the publisher, the SUBJECT
- the subscribers the OBSERVERS

The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when
one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

### Power of loosely coupling
When two objects are loosely coupled, they can interact, but they typically have very little knowledge of each other.

1. First, the only thing the subject knows about an observer is that it implements a certain interface (the Observer interface)
2. We can add new observers at any time.
3. We never need to modify the subject to add new types of observers.
4. We can reuse subjects or observers independently of each other.
5. Changes to either the subject or an observer will not affect the other.

### Issue with the above
The above was only for updating and pusing when there is an update. Howver, it might happen that the observers only need a little bit of the state rather than forcing to get all the data.

### Java's built-in Observer Pattern
The most general is the Observer interface and the Observable class in the `java.util` package.
You can also implement either a push or pull style of update to your observers.
