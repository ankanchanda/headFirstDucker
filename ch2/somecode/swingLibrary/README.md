# The Swing library

### JButton class
JButton’s superclass, AbstractButton has a lot of add/remove listener methods. These methods allow you to add and remove observers—or, as they are called in Swing, listeners—to listen for various types of events that occur on the Swing component.

For instance, an ActionListener lets you “listen in” on any types of actions that might occur on a button, like a button press. You’ll find various types of listeners all over the Swing API.
