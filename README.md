## OO Basics
1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Polymorphism
4. Inheritance

## OO Principles
1. Encapsulate what varies
2. Favor composition over inheritance
3. Program to interfaces, not implementations
4. Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact
5. Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes.

## OO Patterns
### Strategy
Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

### Observer
Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

### Decorator
The Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to sub-classing for extending functionality.

### Factory-Method
The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

## Design Principles
### The Open-Closed Principal
Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
