## OO Basics
1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Polymorphism
4. Inheritance

## OO Principles
1. Encapsulate what varries
2. Favor composition over inheritance
3. Program to interfaces, not implementations
4. Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact

## OO Patterns
### Strategy
Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

### Observer
Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

### Decorator
The Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

## Design Principles
### The Open-Closed Principal
Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
