# Intro to design patterns

1. Program to an interface, not an implementation
2. Enacapsulate what differs
3. Favor composition over inheritance.
4. Strategy Design pattern defines a family of algorithms,
encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy
lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
